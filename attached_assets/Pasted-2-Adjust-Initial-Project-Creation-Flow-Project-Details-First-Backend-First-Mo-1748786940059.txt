2.  **Adjust Initial Project Creation Flow (Project Details First):**
    *   "**Backend First:** Modify the `POST /api/projects` endpoint in `server/routes.ts`. It should primarily expect: `userId`, `title`, `projectType` (default to 'script_analysis' or 'script_generator' based on context, or make it explicit), `logline`, `targetGenres`, `synopsis`. Other fields like `scriptContent`, `status`, `budgetRange`, `fundingGoal`, etc., can be updated in subsequent steps. Ensure it returns the created project, including its `id`.
    *   "**Frontend - New Project Details Form:** Create a new page component: `client/src/pages/dashboard/project-details-form.tsx`.
        *   This page should be routed to from the 'Start New Project' button on the `production-dashboard.tsx`. Change the link in `production-dashboard.tsx` to point to `/production/projects/new-details` (create this route in `App.tsx` pointing to `ProjectDetailsForm`).
        *   The `ProjectDetailsForm` should include inputs for: Project Title, Logline, Target Genre(s) (multi-select/tag input), and Brief Synopsis.
        *   On submission, this form should call the updated `POST /api/projects` endpoint.
        *   After successful project creation and receiving the `projectId`, redirect the user to `/production/projects/${projectId}/script-options` (this will be `client/src/pages/dashboard/project-creation.tsx` adapted to take a `projectId`).
    *   "**Frontend - Adapt Script Options Page:** Modify `client/src/pages/dashboard/project-creation.tsx`:
        *   It should now accept a `projectId` as a URL parameter (e.g., `/production/projects/:id/script-options`). Update `App.tsx` route for `ProjectCreation` accordingly.
        *   The 'Generate Script with AI' link should go to `/production/projects/${projectId}/script-writer`.
        *   The 'Upload Existing Script' link should go to `/production/projects/${projectId}/script-upload`.
    *   "**Frontend - Cleanup Forms:** Remove the fields for Project Title, Logline, Budget Range, Funding Goal, and Production Timeline from `client/src/pages/dashboard/script-analysis-new.tsx` and `client/src/pages/dashboard/script-generator.tsx` as these initial details are now collected upfront. These pages will now primarily handle script content input (upload or generation prompts) for an *existing* project ID."
