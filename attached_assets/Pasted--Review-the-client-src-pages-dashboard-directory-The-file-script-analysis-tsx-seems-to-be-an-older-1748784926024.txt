"Review the client/src/pages/dashboard/ directory. The file script-analysis.tsx seems to be an older version, as script-analysis-new.tsx is also present and likely the active one. Confirm if script-analysis.tsx is unused and can be removed. Also, check if dashboard-home.tsx is still relevant if we are creating role-specific dashboards (e.g., production-dashboard.tsx)."
"Examine the client/src/pages/demos/ directory. These pages (demo-brand.tsx, demo-creator.tsx, demo-financier.tsx, demo-production.tsx, demo-request.tsx) were for demo purposes. Confirm if these are still needed or if their functionality is superseded by the new signup/login and role-based dashboard system. If they are purely for public-facing demo requests and not part of the authenticated user flows, they might be okay, but clarify their purpose. The demo-request.md seems to imply they are for lead generation." (Indeed, demo-request.md suggests they are lead-gen pages and can likely stay).
"The docs/authentication.md file references role-specific dashboards like /production-dashboard. However, client/src/App.tsx doesn't route to production-dashboard.tsx (or other role-specific dashboards like /brand/dashboard, /investor/dashboard, /creator/dashboard). It routes /dashboard to DashboardHome. This suggests DashboardHome.tsx might be a placeholder or needs to be replaced/augmented. Please investigate the intended structure."
Note on Point 3: The docs/authentication.md also says "After successful login, all users are redirected to the unified dashboard: All Roles â†’ /dashboard". This conflicts with the original objective's demand for role-specific dashboard routes. For the following implementation prompts, I will prioritize the original objective (Pasted--Objective-Now-we-have-to-build-a-multi-role-platform-...txt) which explicitly calls for /production/dashboard. If the unified /dashboard is the actual new direction, the agent would need to adapt these prompts to enhance DashboardHome.tsx with role-specific views instead of creating new pages.
