Prompts for Coding Agent (File Cleanup):
"Review the client/src/pages/dashboard/ directory. The file script-analysis.tsx seems to be an older version, as script-analysis-new.tsx is also present and likely the active one. Confirm if script-analysis.tsx is unused and can be removed. Also, check if dashboard-home.tsx is still relevant if we are creating role-specific dashboards (e.g., production-dashboard.tsx)."
"Examine the client/src/pages/demos/ directory. These pages (demo-brand.tsx, demo-creator.tsx, demo-financier.tsx, demo-production.tsx, demo-request.tsx) were for demo purposes. Confirm if these are still needed or if their functionality is superseded by the new signup/login and role-based dashboard system. If they are purely for public-facing demo requests and not part of the authenticated user flows, they might be okay, but clarify their purpose. The demo-request.md seems to imply they are for lead generation."
"The docs/authentication.md file references role-specific dashboards like /production-dashboard. However, client/src/App.tsx doesn't route to production-dashboard.tsx (or other role-specific dashboards like /brand/dashboard, /investor/dashboard, /creator/dashboard). It routes /dashboard to DashboardHome. This suggests DashboardHome.tsx might be a placeholder or needs to be replaced/augmented. Please investigate the intended structure."
"The attached_assets/Pasted--Shared-AI-Client-for-all-agents-This-module-provides-a-consistent-way-to-initialize-an-1748778590746.txt seems to be an older version of server/ai-client.ts. The current server/ai-client.ts supports multiple providers. Please confirm if the pasted text file is just an old reference and can be disregarded or if any useful logic from it was missed."
"The file attached_assets/Pasted-Failed-to-send-confirmation-email-Error-HubSpot-API-error-403-Forbidden-at-HubSpotService-mak-1748769903031.txt contains error logs. This isn't a code file but an asset. Is it still needed for debugging or reference, or can it be removed?"
